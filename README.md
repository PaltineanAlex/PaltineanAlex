- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaltineanAlex
- 👀 My interest in programming started with my passion for videogames, and as of now I am a CS student in Romania that wants to learn more about this field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a small/medium project with a tutor or someone that is on this journey, like me. It would be nice to have someone to relate and talk about this stuff.
